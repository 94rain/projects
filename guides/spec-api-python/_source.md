# Your first Python pipeline

<!-- start description -->
Introductory tutorial to learn the basics of Ploomber.
<!-- end description -->

**Note:** This tutorial is a quick introduction. If you want
to learn about Ploomber's core concepts and design rationale, go to the
[the next tutorial](https://ploomber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/basic-concepts.html).


## Introduction

A pipeline (or **DAG**) is a group of tasks with a particular execution order, where subsequent (or **downstream** tasks) use previous (or **upstream**) tasks as inputs.

This example pipeline contains three tasks, `1-get.py`, `2-clean.py`, and `3-plot.py`.

**Note:** These tasks are Python scripts, but you can use Python functions, Jupyter notebooks, R scripts and SQL scripts.

**Note:** This is a simple three-task pipeline, but Ploomber can manage arbitrarily complex pipelines and dependencies among tasks.

## Integration with Jupyter

Ploomber integrates with Jupyter. If you open the scripts inside the
`jupyter notebook` app, they will render as notebooks. If you're using `jupyter lab`, you need to right click -> open with -> Notebook as shown below:

![lab-open-with-nb](https://ploomber.io/images/doc/lab-open-with-notebook.png)

**Note**: `.ipynb` files are also supported.

Along with the `*.py` files, there is a `pipeline.yaml` file where we declare which files we use as tasks:

<% expand('pipeline.yaml') %>

**Note:** YAML is a human-readable text format similar to JSON; Ploomber uses it to describe the tasks in our pipeline.

### How is execution order determined?

Ploomber infers the pipeline structure from your code. For example, to
clean the data, we must get it first; hence, we declare the following in `2-clean.py`:

~~~python
# this tells Ploomber to execute the '1-get' task before '2-clean'
upstream = ['1-get']
~~~

## Lets plot the pipeline
Let's plot the pipeline:

```bash
ploomber plot
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename='pipeline.png')
```

You can see that our pipeline has a defined execution order: `1-get` -> `2-clean` -> `3-plot`.

## Running the pipeline

Let's run the pipeline:

```bash
# takes a few seconds to finish
ploomber build
```

This pipeline saves all the output in the `output/` directory; we have a few
data files and the output notebooks:

```bash
ls output
```


## Updating the pipeline

Ploomber automatically cache your pipelineâ€™s previous results, and only runs tasks that changed since your last execution. 
To see how it works, execute the following to modify the `2-clean.py` script

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('2-clean.py')
clean = path.read_text()
path.write_text(clean + '\nprint("hello")')
```

Let's now build again:

```bash
# takes a few seconds to finish
ploomber build
```

```python
# restore contents
path.write_text(clean)
```

You'll see that `1-get.py` didn't run because it was not affected by the change!
