# Contributing

Each project must have the same layout:

Required:

* `environment.yml` - File to setup conda environment
* `README.md` - Instructions to execute the project

Optional:

* `setup/script.sh` - Bash script to run any pre-execution steps (`script.py` also works), it is executed with `setup/` as the current working directory
