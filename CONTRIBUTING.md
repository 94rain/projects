# Contributing

Each project must have the same layout:

Required:

* `environment.yml` - Conda environment spec
* `README.md` - Instructions to execute the project
* `output/` - All output files should be stored in a relative folder named `output`

Optional:

* `pipeline.yaml` - If the example uses the Spec API
* `setup/script.sh` - Bash script to run any pre-execution steps (`script.py` also works), it is executed with `setup/` as the current working directory
