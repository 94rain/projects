    "# Pipeline testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing your pipeline is critical to ensure your data expectations hold. When you perform a data transformation, you are expecting the output to have certain properties (e.g. no nulls in certain column). Without testing, these expectations won't be verified and will cause errors errors to propagate to all downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the most common sources of errors when transforming data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A join operation generates duplicated entries because a wrong assumption of a one-to-one relationship (which is really a one-to-many) in the source tables\n",
    "2. A function that aggregates data returns `NULL` because at least one of the input data points was `NULL`\n",
    "3. Dirty data points are used in the analysis (e.g. in a column `age`, you forgot to remove corrupted data points with negative values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these errors are easy to spot (2), but it might take you some tome to find out about others (1 and 3), or worst, you will never notice these errors and just use incorrect data in your analysis. And even if your code is correct and all your expectations hold true, it might not hold true in the future if the data changes and it's important for you to know this as soon as it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make testing effective, **your tests should run every time you run your tasks**. Ploomber has a mechanism to automate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample data\n",

    "\n",
    "Writing data tests is essential for developing robust pipelines. Coding tests is simple, all we have to do is write in code that we already have in our mind when thinking what the outcome of a script should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This thought process happens *before* we write the actual code, which means we could easily write tests even before we write the actual code. This approach is called Test-driven development (TDD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this framework has an added benefit, since we force ourselves to put in concrete terms our data expectations, it makes easier to think how we want to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, *tests also serve as documentation* for us (and for others). By looking at our tests, anyone can see what *our intent* is. Then by looking at the code, it will be easier to spot mismatches between our intent and our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pro tip: debugging and developing tests interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though tests are usually just a few short statements, writing them in an interactive way can help you quickly prototype your assertions. One simple trick you can use to do this is to start an interactive session and load the `client` and `product` variables.\n",
    "\n",
